Hello again.

Before I start this post, I just wanted to say a massive thankyou to all those that read my last post, for all the message of support and all the likes. Some have said I ooze confidence, but, I’m never 100% sure if myself, I'm self-deprecating, and always nervous when presenting. So, the support means so much.

Thank you all.


Today's post, will as I promised in my first post, discuss Collaboration in AEC. I'll discuss the forms of collaboration and some of the pitfalls of each. I will describe some of the solutions I have tried to implement and list the pros and cons. The purpose of the article is to help you avoid making the same mistakes I did.




Collaboration
Firstly, what do I mean by Collaboration, well fundamentally its communication. Whether that be people collaboration or software collaboration. The basis of all collaboration is communication. We need communication to work together with others and achieve something.

Dictionary definition of Collaboration is:

Noun

noun: collaboration; plural noun: collaborations

1.   the action of working with someone to produce something.

§  "he wrote a book in collaboration with his son"

o    something produced in collaboration with someone.

§  "his recent opera was a collaboration with Lessing"

2.   traitorous cooperation with an enemy.

"he faces charges of collaboration"
So how do we collaborate and communicate better, to make sure the projects we work on a successful. Well, that is the million-dollar question and I'm not 100% sure I have the answer. But what I do have are examples and experience I can share with you all.


Processes and Software can help us enable Collaboration, but people are also a big part of the equation. 

Software like Revizto, Microsoft Teams and Zoom (to name just a few) all help to try and connect us so we can collaborate.



Processes like Kanban boards, Lean Collaborative Planning and Comm Cells (Production Control calls).




But with all the software and processes in place, getting people to collaborate can be hard work.

"You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink"

So Why?
Well simply, if we fail to collaborate, projects will fail, overspend, and not be finished on time.

We also, can't be the "Master of all Trades" we need help from others, we need their expertise as well as our own to be successful. Especially in AEC.

Types of Collaboration
Open collaboration

This is when you’re in a group of people from multiple companies, backgrounds, and different levels of experience. This is best for idea sharing and is what most Interdisciplinary Review Meetings are. Especially the ones I run, which include not just the design team, but the contractor, the client, and their maintainer/operator. These meetings will have conflicting views about what is best, and outcomes are generally compromises. 

Best done in person in my opinion, as when working with others we dont know that well we rely on body language to pick up on how others are taking what we are saying. 

Closed collaboration
This is the opposite to above, it is when you work in your team, or with specific people. Generally, this is best to get work done, as you’re all of the same mind and work together to achieve the team goals.




Example of this is preparing a Drainage Design for a highway, yes you will need input from others but generally to complete the work you'll work with likeminded experienced drainage engineers to complete your deliverables.

Doesn't need to be done in person, but social interactions with our colleagues when working can make us more productive, because we are more upbeat.

Cross-functional collaboration
These are what we know as Interdisciplinary Reviews or collaborative Planning sessions where we get as many stakeholders as possible together to discuss issues and resolve problems, whether that me design or planning. As with Open Collaboration there will be lots of conflicting views and ideas in this form of collaboration. 


The key here is Compromise. Give and take. Dont just dig your heels in and expect the other party to budge.

Again, best done in person, but can and should be combined with Virtual collaboration, so that those that can't be at the meetings in person aren't left out. For mixed in-person and virtual, moderators are needed to help those not in the room contribute. Good Internet and audio equipment is a must also, Webcams will also help people feel included.

Cross-cultural collaboration


When working in a huge multinational company or on a global project, you will experience this a lot. Working with others that have different cultural backgrounds and a different primary language can be challenging, especially when words have different meanings. Understanding this fact is the first step to collaborating with others from different backgrounds and people around the world. 

This can be difficult at times as it is easy to forget that cultural differences can mean asking for help or saying you don't understand what is needed can lead to hours of rework.

Take time when working with others and think hard about who you’re working with and what they might have meant, or how they may have understood what your meant. Try not to use jargon, buzzwords, or abbreviations, it will only lead to confusion and frustration.

Virtual collaboration
People Collaboration
The one most practiced these days, on Zoom, Skype, Teams, WebEx, Asana, Revizto (the list goes on). But is it effective? Something is lost in the virtual space, don't you think?




Well yes, as human beings we have developed to communicate with more than our voices, we use body language as a big part of it, and now some may struggle to pick up on all queues (me included) but this is lost especially when you don't use your webcams.

Now, it is my opinion that although this form of collaboration is amazing and probably the future, it is still not good enough to completely replace a face-to-face meeting or simply just working in an office with the people you work with day in day out.

Remote working has been great on many fronts, getting work done without distraction of the office, work life balance and getting rid of the commute (less co2 emissions).

A balance must be struck now between remote working virtual collaboration and collocated office based, there will be some difficult conversations for managers and staff will need to see benefits of office working to draw them back in for the meetings/sessions that need to be face-to-face. And not everything does. 

Software collaboration
Earlier I mentioned collaboration between software, this is more commonly known as interoperability.



This is probably the biggest issue I have faces so fair. Getting people to communicate is nothing compared to getting data into the correct formats for software to understand. This is primarily because as human being we are great at communicating and collaborating. Civilisation are built on it. 

Software not so much, they are designed primarily to work only in the ecosystems of that vendor, only doing what we have told them to do with the file formats that they have been designed to work with. 

This isn't very good when data needs to be transferred from OpenRoads Designer to Civil 3D and back without any data loss. This can be done, but not efficiently and by exporting to other formats like Landxml. Data is lost. IFC could be another file format for transfer between software, but in Civil Infrastructure we are still waiting for the new release to be formalised and taken on board by the big vendors.

Users spend excessive time undertaking these activities when they should be focused on solving engineering problems. I call this "File Format Gymnastics" and it has been the bane of my life since circa 2007.

Enter a solution or at least it will be....

Speckle (and others similar) is an Open-Source platform that converts data from different sources into a version-controlled object database. 




It has connectors with all the most popular design software packages (Bentley is coming).

Direct data streaming from the source software into speckle servers and then back down into another software where the data is displayed not as proxy objects but as native entities.





An Example is provided by Speckle themselves, Civil 3d Pipe Network can be pushed to Speckle and them to Revit, changes made, and it pushed back. Speckle systems article on this is here.

I'll discuss more about Interoperability in a post later. But you all get the idea, software collaboration is just as important. It makes our lives easier.

Summary
To truly, achieve project/task goals on time and under budget, all forms of Collaboration are needed. The key is knowing when each form is best for your meetings/sessions.

Before jumping onto Outlook and sending a meeting invite with a Teams Meeting link, think what would work best. Should I book a meeting room? Should I ask the attendees what they think? 

Communication is everything in AEC and the more we talk, share ideas, and listen to others the better we all will be for it.

Open Source is great to help answer some of the issue we face from Vendor's software not talking but it is only one piece of the puzzle, we still need those powerful software packages to help use design and convey our design to others so that it can be built and hopefully benefit us all.

Next Post
For my next post, I'd like your input, what would you all like me to discuss next? I have a few subjects already lined up and have added them to a poll. Link here. Please vote for the subject you like me to talk about next.
